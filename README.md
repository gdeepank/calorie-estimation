## Deep Learning-Based Food Calorie Estimation

The main objective of the project was to estimate calories using PixelLib library and Mask-RCNN algorithm. [ECUSTFD](https://github.com/Liang-yc/ECUSTFD-resized-) was the dataset used in this project. It is a free public food image dataset.

### *Approach*

- Image Acquisition
- Object Detection 
- Instance Segmentation 
- Volume Estimation (for formula refer to this [Research Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.04062.pdf))
- Calorie Estimation (from calorie density information)
